# TieredResNet Model

## Overview
This project implements an advanced TieredResNet model for image classification tasks with a focus on adversarial robustness. The model architecture uses a tiered approach to ResNet design that enhances performance against adversarial attacks.

## Features
- Custom TieredResNet architecture
- Adversarial training capabilities
- Performance evaluation tools
- Image preprocessing utilities

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.9+
- torchvision
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/esfahani-moein/TieredResNet_Model.git
cd TieredResNet_Model
pip install -r requirements.txt
